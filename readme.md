### :loudspeaker: About Me
I work as a software developer. Outside of work, I develop games and mods for games I own. I'm facinated with game security and bypassing anti-cheat systems. Most of my repos/projects are private since I don't want certain mods I've written to be used by people in any online games.

I've been programming since 2013, and I'm almost completely self-taught. I mainly use C# and Java, but I also know Lua, JavaScript, Python, C++, and PHP.
