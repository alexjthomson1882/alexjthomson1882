### :loudspeaker: About Me
I'm a software developer with a fascination towards bypassing anti-cheat and security systems for games. I've kept lots of my projects/repos private since they contain mods I've written that could be used in online games. Contact me if you have any questions.

I've been programming since 2013, and I'm almost completely self-taught; I mainly use C# and Java, but I'm also familiar with Lua, JavaScript, Python, C++, and PHP.
