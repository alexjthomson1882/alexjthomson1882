### :loudspeaker: About Me
I work as a software developer. Outside of work I usually develop games and write mods/hacks for games I own. Most of my projects are private since I don't want other people using some of the mods/hacks I've written online.

I've been programming since 2013, and I'm almost completely self-taught. My main languages include C#, Java, Lua, and JavaScript. I also know Python, C++, and PHP.
